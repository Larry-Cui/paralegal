A lot of people in the firm sacrifice their working time to teach me on every bits of details at work. I can tell they really want me to pick up the work soon, so they can trust me with more important work. </p> <p>That's a strange feeling: you know you may work for a firm for quite a long time, but people there treat you from the first day of the work as if they know you will stay there forever, is quite different. </p> <p>So I guess, maybe I need to be more serious about this job, and behave like a professional as people here see me. </p> <p>Yup, here I am. Taking notes is the only way I can think of to efficiently and effectively collect every bit of knowledge I come across at work.  </p> <p>But putting notes online? Basically it's a kind of showcase, but it does come with some side effects:</p> <ul> <li>It prompts me to take notes more often;</li> <li>It offers me an easy access to the notes for review. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/newpolicy/","title":"A New Policy","text":""},{"location":"about/newpolicy/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Before 27 June 2023, foreign workers in Canada cannot enrol in any study programs that last longer than six month.
